-- This ert configuration file is an example which can be used to check that your
-- local ert installation is basically sane. This example is not meant to be used
-- as an automatically run integration test, rather it is meant to be tested
-- interactively. In addition to the compiled application this will also verify that
-- the various configuration files are reasonably correctly stitched together.
--
-- To actually test this invoke the ert binary you have installed and give the path to
-- this file as argument:
--
--    /path/to/installed/ert/bin/ert example.ert
-- 
-- The example is based on the ECLIPSE100 forward model, that implies that you must
-- configure the local eclipse related details corresponding to your site[1].
-- 
-- NB: the current case has *not* been carefully constructed to demonstrate the
-- capabilities of ert; from a model updating perspective the current case is
-- totally uninteresting.
-- 
-- [1]: This amounts to editing the file ecl_config.yml in the res.fm.ecl python
-- package from the libres installation. See the documentation in the
-- ecl_config.yml example file supplied with the libres distribution, or
-- alternatively the "Post install configuration" section in the libres README.
