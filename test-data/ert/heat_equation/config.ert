-- By default, NumPy utilizes multiple threads, which is beneficial for parallelizable computations.
-- However, the heat equation implementation in this case does not benefit from parallel execution within a single realization.
-- When ERT runs multiple realizations, each one by default uses multiple threads for NumPy operations,
-- leading to resource contention and slower overall execution.
-- Setting these thread counts to 1 ensures each realization uses minimal resources,
-- allowing more realizations to run concurrently and significantly speeding up the entire experiment.
