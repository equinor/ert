    Perform 'Auto Scaling' to mitigate issues with correlated observations in ensemble smoothers.

    This method was developed internally to address challenges with correlated observations
    in ensemble smoothers, which can lead to overconfident updates. Originally named
    'Misfit Preprocessor', it was renamed to 'Auto Scaling' as it doesn't calculate misfits.

    The procedure involves several steps:

    1. Response Scaling:
        Each response in the data is scaled by its corresponding observation error.
        This is done to balance the responses by their uncertainties.
        By multiplying each response by its corresponding observation error,
        we're weighting the responses based on their uncertainty.
        Responses with larger observation errors (more uncertainty) will
        be scaled up, while those with smaller errors will be scaled down.
        Different types of observations might have different units or scales.
        By scaling them with their respective errors, we're putting all responses
        on a comparable scale, which is important for subsequent clustering and PCA.
    2. PCA for Dimensionality Estimation:
        PCA is performed on the centered and scaled
        responses to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of the data.
        The number of principal components that cumulatively explain a predefined
        percentage of variance (e.g., 95%) is determined.
    3. Hierarchical Clustering:
        Based on the dimensionality estimated by PCA,
        a hierarchical clustering is performed using the Spearman correlation
        matrix of the scaled responses.
        Clustering is done to identify groups of observations with similar variation patterns.
        Using the number of principal components as the number of clusters is not a widely
        common technique in clustering analysis.
        Potential rationale (the creator of method did not document the reasoning behind the method):
        The number of principal components to explain 95% of the variance can be seen as
        an estimate of the intrinsic dimensionality of the data.
        Using this as the number of clusters assumes that each major direction of variance
        could correspond to a distinct cluster.
        This methods allows the number of clusters to be data-driven rather than pre-determined,
        which can be advantageous in some scenarios.
        One potential issue is that data can have a certain number of significant dimension but
        a different number of natural clusters.
    4. Cluster-Based PCA and Scaling:
        For each cluster, PCA is performed to determine the number of principal components that
        explain a specified percentage of variance within that cluster.
        A scaling factor for the observation errors is then calculated as the square root
        of the ratio of the number of observations in the cluster to the number of principal components.
        The specific formula used is not a standard approach, but may nevertheless be reasonable.
        The ratio of observations to principal components is somewhat analogous to degress of freedom
        in statistical analyses. Scaling by a function of this ratio could be seen as an attempt
        to adjust for the effective sample size.
