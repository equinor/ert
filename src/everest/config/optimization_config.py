            To calculate gradients, the optimizer requests a number of forward

            ways to calculate the gradient of the objective function:

            1. For each realization, `perturbation_num` objective functions are
               evaluated with perturbed controls, which will be used to
               calculate a gradient for that realization. The gradient
               calculation for a single realization is considered successful if
               at least `min_pert_success` forward model runs for that
               realization are successful. The overall gradient can be
               calculated from the set of realization gradients if a sufficient
               number succeeded (see the `min_realizations_success` option). If
               not, the optimization terminates with an error.
            2. If the `perturbation_num` field is equal to 1, the overall
               gradient is directly calculated from a single perturbation for
               each realization. In this case `min_pert_success` is internally
               set to 1, and the number of successful realizations is equal to
               the number of successful perturbed runs. The gradient calculation
               succeeds if this is at least equal to `min_realizations_success`.

            Note: The value of `min_pert_success` is internally adjusted to be
            capped by `perturbation_num`.

            Minimum number of successful realizations.

            The overall objective functions and gradients are calculated from a
            set of forward model runs for a number of realizations of an
            ensemble. This is done by aggregating the functions and gradients,
            usually by averaging. If one or more of the forward model
            evaluations fail, this may lead to a failure of either the function
            or the gradient evaluation. However, the number of realizations that
            are successfully evaluated may still be sufficient to calculate
            robust aggregated functions and gradients.

            To calculate the aggregated objective function and gradient, the
            number of successful forward models that calculate the objective
            function for each realization must be at least equal to
            `min_realizations_success`. The number of realizations that are
            successful in terms of the gradient calculation is additionally
            determined by the `min_pert_success` field, see its documentation
            for more details.

            If these requirements are not met, the optimizer will stop and
            report an error.

            Note: The value of `min_realizations_success` is internally adjusted
            to be capped by the number of realizations. It is possible to set
            the minimum number of successful realizations equal to zero. Some
            optimization algorithms are able to handle this and will proceed
            even if all realizations failed. Most algorithms are not capable of

            When running forward models in parallel, e.g. on a computing

            each function evaluation. The reason is that the optimizer may be
            able to use the gradient in a next iteration. Although this wastes
            resources if the gradient is not used, it may save clock time, since
