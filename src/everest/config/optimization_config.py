The convergence_tolerance specification provides a real value for controlling
the termination of iteration.  In most cases, it is a relative convergence tolerance
for the objective function; i.e., if the change in the objective function between
successive iterations divided by the previous objective function is less than
the amount specified by convergence_tolerance, then this convergence criterion is
satisfied on the current iteration.

Since no progress may be made on one iteration followed by significant progress
on a subsequent iteration, some libraries require that the convergence tolerance
be satisfied on two or more consecutive iterations prior to termination of
iteration.
