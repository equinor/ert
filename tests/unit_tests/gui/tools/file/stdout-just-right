And Saint Attila raised the hand grenade up on high, saying, 'O Lord, bless
this thy hand grenade, that with it thou mayst blow thine enemies to tiny bits,
in thy mercy.' And the Lord did grin. And the people did feast upon the lambs,
and sloths, and carp, and anchovies, and orangutans, and breakfast cereals, and
fruit bats, and large chulapas. And the Lord spake, saying, 'First shalt thou
take out the Holy Pin. Then shalt thou count to three, no more, no less. Three
shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be
three. Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou
then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once the number three, being the
third number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch
towards thy foe, who, being naughty in My sight, shall snuff it.'
