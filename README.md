ert - Ensemble based Reservoir Tool - is designed for running
ensembles of dynamical models such as reservoir models,
in order to do sensitivity analysis and data assimilation.
ert supports data assimilation using the Ensemble Smoother (ES),
Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ES-MDA) and
Iterative Ensemble Smoother (IES).

## Installation

```sh
$ pip install ert
$ ert --help
```

or, for the latest development version:

```sh
$ pip install git+https://github.com/equinor/ert.git@main
$ ert --help
```

For examples and help with configuration, see the [ert Documentation](https://ert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/configuration/poly_new/guide.html#configuration-guide).

# Everestâ„¢

The primary goal of the Everest tool is to find *optimal* well
planning and production strategies by utilizing an ensemble of
reservoir models (e.g., an ensemble of geologically-consistent models).
This will enable robust decisions about drilling schedule and well
placement, in order to achieve results of significant practical value.

```sh
    pip install . "[everest]"
```

## Developing

To start developing the Python code, we suggest installing ert in editable mode
into a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to
isolate the install (substitute the appropriate way of sourcing venv for your shell):

```sh
# Create and enable a virtualenv
python3 -m venv my_virtualenv
source my_virtualenv/bin/activate

# Update build dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip

# Download and install ert
git clone https://github.com/equinor/ert
cd ert
pip install --editable ".[dev, everest]"
```

### Test setup

Additional development packages must be installed to run the test suite:

```sh
pip install -e ".[dev, everest]"
pytest tests/
```

There are many kinds of tests in the `tests` directory, while iterating on your
code you can run a fast subset of the tests with

```sh
pytest -n logical tests/ert/unit_tests -m "not integration_tests"
```

[Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) must be installed to get all the files. This is packaged as `git-lfs` on Ubuntu, Fedora or macOS Homebrew. For Equinor RGS node users, it is possible to use `git` from Red Hat Software Collections:
```sh
source /opt/rh/rh-git227/enable
```

If you have not used git-lfs before, you might have to make changes to your global Git config for git-lfs to work properly.
```sh
git lfs install
```

test-data/ert/block_storage is a submodule and must be checked out.
```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

If you checked out submodules without having git lfs installed, you can force git lfs to run in all submodules with:
```sh
git submodule foreach "git lfs pull"
```

### Build documentation

You can build the documentation after installation by running
```sh
pip install ".[dev]"
sphinx-build -n -v -E -W ./docs/ert ./tmp/ert_docs
```
and then open the generated `./tmp/ert_docs/index.html` in a browser.

To automatically reload on changes you may use

```sh
sphinx-autobuild docs docs/_build/html
```

### Style requirements

There are a set of style requirements, which are gathered in the `pre-commit`
configuration, to have it automatically run on each commit do:

```sh
$ pip install pre-commit
$ pre-commit install
```

### Trouble with setup

As a simple test of your `ert` installation, you may try to run one of the
examples, for instance:

```
cd test-data/ert/poly_example
# for non-gui trial run
ert test_run poly.ert
# for gui trial run
ert gui poly.ert
```

### Notes

The default maximum number of open files is normally relatively low on MacOS
and some Linux distributions. This is likely to make tests crash with mysterious
error-messages. You can inspect the current limits in your shell by issuing the
command `ulimit -a`. In order to increase maximum number of open files, run
`ulimit -n 16384` (or some other large number) and put the command in your
`.profile` to make it persist.

## Example usage

### Basic ert test
To test if ert itself is working, go to `test-data/ert/poly_example` and start ert by running `poly.ert` with `ert gui`
```sh
cd test-data/ert/poly_example
ert gui poly.ert
```
This opens up the ert graphical user interface.
Finally, test ert by starting and successfully running the experiment.

### ert with a reservoir simulator
To actually get ert to work at your site you need to configure details about
your system; at the very least this means you must configure where your
reservoir simulator is installed. In addition you might want to configure e.g.
queue system in the `site-config` file, but that is not strictly necessary for
a basic test.
