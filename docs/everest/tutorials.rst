EVEREST is extensively used for devising optimal field development and reservoir
management strategies. For more information see: `EVEREST website
<https://everest.tools/>`_.

For these types of optimization problems, EVEREST is generally used together
with the ``everest-models`` plugin (See section :ref:`cha_everest_models`). A
set of tutorials for solving various optimization problems with EVEREST and
``everest-models``, based on the synthetic Drogon reservoir model, can be found
here: `EVEREST tutorials <https://equinor.github.io/everest-tutorials/>`_.
