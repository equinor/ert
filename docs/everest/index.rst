Everestâ„¢ documentation
======================

This guide serves as documentation for the *Everest* decision-making tool.

* The intended readers are reservoir engineers and others involved in reservoir management and well planning.
* Everest is developed with the use of multiple realization models/ensemble models in mind. Everest can be used both for optimization on single realizations and multiple realizations.
* Everest could for example be used as decision support tool for well planning (drilling order) and drainage strategy optimization.
