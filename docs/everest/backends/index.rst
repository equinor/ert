    optimization
    sampling

The optimization functionality of Everest is determined by optimization backends that provide the low-level optimization algorithms. For details about the optimization backends that are included with Everest, see section :ref:`cha_optimization_backends`.

Similarly, the sampling methods that are used to generate perturbations for gradient calculation are provided by sampling backends, which are described in section: :ref:`cha_sampling_backends`.

Additional backends may be provided with your local Everest installation, consult your systems manager for options.
