The forward model
=================

Purpose
-------

The task of the forward model is to bring the model under study forward and by
doing so create its response to the given input. For an overview of how the
forward model fits into the larger picture of an ensemble we refer the reader
to :doc:`concepts`.

ERT forward models
------------------

Currently, an ERT forward model is a list of shell commands, called steps
(previously called jobs), that are executed sequentially. There is some
additional context surrounding each step that can be configured in the step
configuration file, like environment variables and default argument values.
However, it quickly boils down to sequential shell commands using the
underlying file system for data communication.

The input to a forward model consists of:

- a local disk area where the forward model is to be executed, the *runpath*
  of the forward model
- some of the parameters (:code:`GEN_KW` parameters) persisted as *JSON* in
  the root of the runpath in a file named :code:`parameters.json`.
- surface and field parameters (2D and 3D parameters) persisted directly into
  the reservoir model.
- A description of the forward model as *JSON* in the root of the runpath in a
  file named :code:`jobs.json` (this filename is kept for legacy reasons)
- The magic strings (string to string mapping for replacement) are being
  replaced in the runpath.

After this, the forward model is submitted to the queue system. In particular,
this entails that the script :code:`fm_dispatch.py` is executed with the runpath of
the forward model as an argument. It will locate the :code:`jobs.json` file and
execute the forward model as prescribed. During execution the status of the
forward model is dumped to the :code:`status.json` file. It contains information
about whether each step was a success or failure, the start and end running
time, memory usage and so forth. In addition, each step's standard out and
standard error is piped to unique files for each step. Both the status
file and the log files are picked up again by the core for monitoring
purposes.

The run environment of the forward model using a plain ERT installation is the
same as the core. That entails that environment variables are carried over and
one assumes that the disk where the relevant environment is installed is also
available when running the forward model. Furthermore, the system is configured
in Equinor such that the named deploy used by the core is persisted to disk and
then picked up again on the forward model side to ensure that upgrades are not
impacting already launched runs.

After the forward model is completed, the overall status of the forward model
is signaled back to the core through a network message. If it failed a file
:code:`ERROR` is also produced at the root of the runpath. After this, response loading is
initiated by the core. In particular, summary data is loaded from the
configured :code:`ECLBASE` and in addition the various :code:`GEN_DATA` etc.
responses are loaded from their configured files. If the loading of responses
is also successful, the forward model in its entirety is deemed successful by
the core.
