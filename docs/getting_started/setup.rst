Setup
=====

If you work at Equinor you should have ert available after sourcing a komodo release. Run the command::

    source /prog/res/komodo/stable/enable

Then you can test the installation by running::

    ert --help

If you get a message explaining how to use ERT, you are ready.

If you don't have access to komodo, you might have another means of using it in your
organisation. If not, you have to `build and install <https://github.com/equinor/ert>`_ it yourself.
