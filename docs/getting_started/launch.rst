Launching ERT
-------------

In order to run ERT you first need an ERT installation and an ERT config (See: :doc:`configuration/poly_new/guide`).

Before you can launch ERT you should change directory (in the terminal) to the ERT project folder.

The most common way to launch ERT is using the graphical user interface (GUI).
Given that you have a ERT configuration file you want to run, the program is launched as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   ert gui config.ert

To see the full documentation of the available commands and how to run the command line interface (CLI),
see :doc:`../reference/running_ert`.
