The keywords that are recognized by the Everest configuration system are
described below. Each keyword is followed by its data type in brackets, usually
some basic type. It may also be a list, which indicates that the keyword can be
repeated as a yaml list. If a keyword is required, this is also indicated in
brackets after the keyword name.
