## Pre review checklist

- [ ] Read through the code changes carefully after finishing work
- [ ] Make sure tests pass locally (after every commit!)
- [ ] Prepare changes in small commits for more convenient review (optional)
- [ ] PR title captures the intent of the changes, and is fitting for release notes.
- [ ] Updated documentation
- [ ] Ensured that unit tests are added for all new behavior (See [Ground Rules](https://github.com/equinor/ert/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#ground-rules)), and changes to existing code have good test coverage.

## Pre merge checklist
- [ ] Added appropriate release note label
- [ ] Commit history is consistent and clean, in line with the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/equinor/ert/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
