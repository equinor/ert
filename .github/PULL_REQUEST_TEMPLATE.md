## Pre review

- [ ] Read through the code changes carefully after finishing work
- [ ] Make sure tests pass locally (after every commit!)
- [ ] PR title captures the intent of the changes, and is fitting for release notes.

## If applicable
- [ ] **When there are user facing changes**: Updated documentation
- [ ] **New behavior or changes to existing untested code**: Ensured that unit tests are added (See [Ground Rules](https://github.com/equinor/ert/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#ground-rules)).
- [ ] **Large PR**: Prepare changes in small commits for more convenient review
- [ ] **Bug fix**: Add regression test for the bug
- [ ] **Bug fix**: Create Backport PR to latest release

## Pre merge
- [ ] Added appropriate release note label
- [ ] Commit history is consistent and clean, in line with the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/equinor/ert/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
