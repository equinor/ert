# Copilot Code Review Instructions

Apply these instructions only when performing a code review for this repository.
Focus on: correctness, clarity, reliability, and maintainability.

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] All new or changed logic is covered by appropriate automated tests.
- [ ] Test names follow the `test_that_<behavior_or_condition>` specification style.
- [ ] Test names clearly state the expected behavior or invariant (they answer: “What is correct behavior?”).
- [ ] Test names avoid vague terms: `works`, `correctly`, `as_expected`, `are_handled`, `handles`, `success`, `failure`, etc.
- [ ] Unit tests in `tests/ert/unit_tests` (not marked `integration_test`) are fast, reliable, and produce clear error messages.
- [ ] UI tests (in `tests/ert/ui_tests`) describe user-visible interactions and outcomes.
- [ ] Each commit performs one atomic, logically isolated change.
- [ ] Commit messages follow the prescribed format and explain the *what* and *why*, not the detailed *how*.
- [ ] Code does not contain trivial or redundant documentation.
- [ ] There is no commented-out (dead) code.
- [ ] User-facing changes include/update relevant `.rst` documentation under `docs/`.

## 1. Testing

### 1.1 Coverage
Ensure all new functional paths or behaviors introduced by the PR are covered with unit tests or integration/UI tests as appropriate.

### 1.2 Naming Style
Test names MUST:
- Start with `test_that_` (or `test_when_` if describing conditional sequences) and then explicitly describe the behavior, condition, or invariant.
- Read like an executable specification: someone running `pytest --collect-only tests/` should infer purpose without opening the test file.

Good examples:
- `test_that_adaptive_localization_with_cutoff_1_equals_ensemble_prior`
- `test_that_adaptive_localization_with_cutoff_0_equals_ESupdate`
- `test_that_posterior_generalized_variance_increases_in_cutoff`
- `test_that_missing_arglist_does_not_affect_subsequent_calls`
- `test_that_setenv_does_not_expand_envvar`
- `test_that_new_line_can_be_escaped`
- `test_that_unknown_queue_option_gives_error_message`
- `test_when_forward_model_contains_multiple_steps_just_one_checksum_status_is_given`
- `test_that_config_path_substitution_is_the_name_of_the_configs_directory`

Poor examples (too vague, not behavior-focused, etc.):
- `test_color_always`
- `test_legends`
- `test_result_success`
- `test_result_failure`
- `test_print_progress`
- `test_bad_user_config_file_error_message`

### 1.3 Avoid Vague Terms (“Name Smells”)
Reject test names containing ambiguous fillers, e.g.:
- `works`, `correctly`, `as_expected`, `are_handled`, `handles`, `success`, `failure`
These words state *judgment* rather than *behavior*. Replace with the explicit condition or outcome.

Instead of: `test_that_arglist_is_parsed_correctly`
Prefer: `test_that_arglist_parsing_preserves_quoted_values` (be precise about the correctness criterion).

Instead of: `test_that_history_observation_errors_are_calculated_correctly`
Prefer: `test_that_history_observation_relative_error_is_a_percentage_of_the_value`

Instead of: `test_that_double_comments_are_handled`
Prefer: `test_that_double_comments_are_ignored`

(NOTE: If the PR contains any of the vague forms above, recommend renaming.)

### 1.4 Fast, Reliable Unit Tests
Tests in `tests/ert/unit_tests` not marked `integration_test` MUST:
- Execute quickly (aim: sub-second or minimal dependency overhead).
- Have deterministic outcomes (no flaky timing, random seeds un-fixed, or external service reliance).
- Produce clear, concise assertion failure messages.

Definition of “integration_test” marker: Use it only when a test is slow,
interacts with external systems/resources, involves complex multi-component
orchestration, or commonly yields opaque errors. If a test fails any of the
fast/reliable criteria, ensure it is marked appropriately or refactored.

### 1.5 UI Tests
Tests in `tests/ert/ui_tests` SHOULD:
- Reflect user-visible workflows (actions + expected UI states).
- Avoid duplicating pure logic assertions that are already covered in unit tests.

## 2. Commit Messages

Each commit SHOULD represent one atomic concern (e.g., “Refactor parameter parsing”, “Add adaptive localization cutoff test”).

Commit message format:
1. Subject line:
   - Limit to 50 characters
   - Imperative mood (e.g., “Add…”, “Refactor…”, “Remove…”).
   - Capitalized first letter.
   - No trailing period.
2. Blank line separating subject from body (if body exists).
3. Body (wrap at ~72 chars):
   - Explain WHY and WHAT changed (focus on rationale + scope).
   - Avoid detailing HOW unless unusual design decisions require justification.
   - Reference related tests or docs if helpful.

Reject commits that bundle unrelated changes (e.g., test addition + API rename + lint fixes) unless explicitly justified.

---

## 3. Documentation

- Avoid trivial docstrings that restate the obvious (`get_count()` does not need “Return count”).
- Remove commented-out code blocks; if something is temporarily disabled, use version control (or explain in commit message) rather than comments.
- For user-facing changes (new features, changed behaviors, configuration adjustments), ensure an `.rst` file under `docs/` is added or updated:
  - Include usage examples.
  - State backward compatibility or migration notes if applicable.

---

## 4. Prioritization

Address in order:
1. Incorrect or missing tests for critical logic.
2. Flaky or slow unit tests not marked as integration.
3. Poorly named tests (vague or non-spec style).
4. Commit message policy violations.
5. Documentation gaps.
6. Minor style / incidental issues.

Provide concise, actionable suggestions—avoid generic praise or ungrounded criticism.
